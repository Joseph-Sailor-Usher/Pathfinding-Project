# Unity VR Project: Kansas Towns Pathfinder

Welcome to the Unity VR project for your AI class! This project allows you to explore towns in Kansas and experiment with pathfinding algorithms in a VR environment.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize Google Maps data of towns in Kansas and a directed adjacency list to create a VR experience where you can visualize and experiment with pathfinding algorithms.

### Features

- Import and display Kansas town data from Google Maps.
- Interactive table interface in VR.
- Set start and finish locations using grabbable objects.
- Adjust the tick rate of the algorithm with a slider.
- Generate and visualize paths between towns.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Unity installed, along with the necessary VR plugins compatible with your headset (e.g., Oculus, HTC Vive).

2. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unity-vr-kansas-pathfinder.git
    ```

3. **Open in Unity**: Open the project in Unity.

4. **Import Google Maps Data**: Follow the instructions in the project to import Google Maps data for Kansas towns.

5. **Build and Run**: Build the project for your VR headset and run it.

## Usage

- Place the VR headset on and enter the VR environment.

- Interact with the table to set start and finish locations using the grabbable objects.

- Use the slider to adjust the tick rate of the algorithm for real-time path visualization.

- Click the "Generate Path" button to initiate the pathfinding algorithm and visualize the result.
